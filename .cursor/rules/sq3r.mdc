## SQ3R Method (Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review)

Apply the SQ3R reading comprehension method when analyzing code, documentation, or learning new concepts:

### Survey (S)

- Quickly skim files, modules, or documentation by examining titles, headings, function signatures, class names, comments, and key structures
- Get a general overview of the codebase or concept before diving deep
- Identify key components, patterns, and architectural decisions

### Question (Q)

- Turn headings, function names, and module purposes into questions
- Example: Change "UserAuthentication" into "How does user authentication work?" or "What are the authentication requirements?"
- Create a purpose for deeper investigation by formulating specific questions to answer

### Read (R)

- Read code or documentation actively, focusing on finding answers to your formulated questions
- Take notes on main points, paraphrase logic flows, and highlight essential patterns or decisions
- Connect implementations to their purposes and requirements

### Recite (R)

- After analyzing a section, explain the main points in your own words without looking at the code
- Answer the questions you formulated earlier from memory
- Verify your understanding by articulating how components work and why they're designed that way

### Review (R)

- Go over your notes and the code/documentation again
- Test your understanding by explaining the material or predicting behavior
- Solidify comprehension through spaced repetition and cross-referencing related concepts

Always ask: "Do I understand this well enough to explain it without looking at the source?"
