## Break Down and Simplify

- Break down the problem into smaller subProblems, solve the simplest first and then build on top of that
- Break the problem into smaller problems(Which is simplification) and try to solve smaller problems first.
These smaller problems are based on constraints mainly.
For example

1. If the size of input array can be 10^5, try to solve for 10^3 first

2. If the input can contain any integers, try to solve for positive integers first.

Like this try to solve a simpler version of the problem and try to build on top of that
