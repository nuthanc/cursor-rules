## Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)

Apply the Pareto Principle in all work and decision-making:

- Focus on the 20% of efforts that deliver 80% of the value
- Prioritize the 20% of problems that cause 80% of issues
- Optimize the 20% of processes that handle 80% of use cases
- When implementing solutions, start with the core 20% that provides most value before adding edge cases
- In any task, prioritize the 20% of work that is most critical or impactful
- When troubleshooting, investigate the 20% of areas most likely to contain the issue first
- Identify and leverage the 20% of resources, tools, or methods that produce 80% of results

Always ask: "What's the 20% that will give us 80% of the result?"
